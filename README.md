# Project Overview: Cafe & Wifi API
The Cafe & Wifi API is a RESTful api service designed to manage information about cafes, including their locations, amenities, and services such as Wi-Fi availability, seats, price etc. The API provides endpoints for searching cafes by location, retrieving random cafes, fetching all cafes, adding new cafes, updating coffee prices for existing cafes, and deleting cafes from the database.

# Database Management
The project utilizes an SQLite database to manage cafe information efficiently. SQLite is a lightweight, serverless relational database engine that stores data in a single file, making it easy to manage and deploy for small to medium-scale applications like this one.

# Technologies Used

* Python: Used for developing the API endpoints and handling requests/responses.
* Flask: A micro web framework for Python used to create the RESTful API.
* SQLite: The relational database management system used to store and manage cafe data.
* Postman: A popular API client used for testing and documentation.
